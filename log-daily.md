Secured this account with MFA; very easy to do.  I used the \
tutorial/introduction pull request/clone tool; cool but not my style. \
Now I understand the web GUI, it is time to return to my beloved terminal. \
I’ve forgotten how to use git twice.  Developers have a reason to use git, \
but I’m not a developer; yet! \

I’ll start with bujo (bullet journal system).  I can write and that’s \
all I need to start with git.  I wanted to use the *unicode bullet* for my \
bullet journal.  After some research I now know the process of typing unicode \
characters on the fly verses copy/paste from the character map program like \
an animal. \

First, use key combinations `alt` + `shift` + `u`.  Now type the code `2022`, \
then press `space` or `enter`.  In my 1950’s console guy voice, “Houston \
we can use bullets”. \
