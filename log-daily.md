• 1840. Secured this account with MFA; very easy to do.  I used the \
tutorial/introduction pull request/clone tool; cool but not my style. \
Now I understand the web GUI, it is time to return to my beloved terminal. \
I’ve forgotten how to use git twice.  Developers have a reason to use git, \
but I’m not a developer; yet! \

I’ll start with bujo (bullet journal system).  I can write and that’s \
all I need to start with git.  I wanted to use the *unicode bullet* for my \
bullet journal.  After some research I now know the process of typing unicode \
characters on the fly verses copy/paste from the character map program like \
an animal. \

First, use key combinations `alt` + `shift` + `u`.  Now type the code `2022`, \
then press `space` or `enter`.  In my 1950’s console guy voice, “Houston \
we can use bullets”. \

• 1950. Now I need to research Github’s markdown flavor. I’m currently using  
Pandoc flavor markdown. Github seems to do something strange with the  
hard breaks on lines followed by empty lines. Maybe I’ll use double  
spaces for line breaks, or I could quit guessing and just research Github  
flavor markdown.  
*Sigh:*  The things we do for markdown.

• 14:49. Learned about Github flavored markdown (GFM). Follows common  
mark. I changed the license to GPL too. I just wanted to know how to  
change license, not that GPL is better for journal.  

• 15:07. It worked! I'm the greatest novice to ever push buttons  
on a website in the entire **world** (dramatic echo added to  
world). Also I forgot to add the link to the github documentation for  
[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).  

• 15:15. Small format changes to the previous content. I'll leave the  
hard breaks to show visual progress for future Sgoti; he's stupid and  
will need to be reminded.  

• 23:21. OMG, it took forever to learn how to do this from the command  
line! I first cloned my repo from github.com then attempted to see  
my changes made during the (15:07 - 15:15) times. The changes where  
committed/pending and I didn't want to merge using the GUI. Locally I  
changed branches about 20 times `git checkout` trying to figure out why  
I couldn't see the pending changes. Took a break to drink some of my poor  
mans' instant coffee; it simply has to do the job. Now with the taste of  
sun baked tree bark in my mouth I needed to `git` some work done. I read  
over the "Pro git" book some more, attempted some `git fetch` action;  
no luck. Dropped a few magical four letter words then ran a `git pull`;  
this did the trick. I wanted to do the merge manually/separately but  
guess I'll save that adventure for future Sgoti; he's got nothing better  
to do. So in short, I failed my way to success again. Looking forward  
to doing it all over tomorrow. I don't remember if I said this or not,  
I'm doing all of this from the CLI using vim from now on. The web GUI  
gives a better visual on the new information in the branches (scratch-pad  
and quick-notes) but I'll have to get use to it in my home; good ol  
colorful text on a black background. Brain fog is kicking in, time to  
push this puppy to origin. Remember kids if you're going to boink it,  
boink it with sudo! Sgoti:wq
